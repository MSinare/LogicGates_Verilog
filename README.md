# LogicGates_Verilog
The commit includes a verilog file and its testbench file. The verilog file includes implementation of NOT, AND, OR and XOR gates.
There are two select bits to select one gate, the selection goes as follows
select = 00 => NOT gate with A as input
select = 01 => AND gate
select = 10 => OR gate
select = 11 => XOR gate

There are three different implementation models, gate level, dataflow and behavioural. Two of them are commented.
